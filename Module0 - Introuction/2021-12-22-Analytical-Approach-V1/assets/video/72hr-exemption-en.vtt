00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today, we are talking about pre-arrival test exemptions when re-entering Canada within 72 hours.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As of November 30, 2021, fully vaccinated travellers, who are absent from Canada for 72 hours or less will not require a pre-departure

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.600
test, prior to returning to Canada, provided that:

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.233
They have completed ArriveCan and are asymptomatic, and they have a valid Proof of Vaccine or are a traveller with a medically

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.366
confirmed contraindication to the COVID-19 vaccine,

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.499
or are under the age of 12.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.900
This exemption will apply to Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and persons registered under the Indian Act departing from and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.133
returning to Canada by land or air.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:46.399
The 72-hour exemption does not apply to travellers entering Canada through marine points of entry, nor to travellers who have been

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.566
in a country of concern, identified due to the Omicron variant, as they are subject to Enhanced Public Health Measures regardless

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.266
of their time outside of the country.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:59.032
Canada Border Services Agents will be calculating the duration of absence from Canada.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.033
The traveller’s period of absence from Canada will be calculated as follows:

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:11.033
From the actual departure time from Canada to the actual return time to Canada (if travelling by land) or

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:19.733
from the initial scheduled departure flight time, outbound from Canada, to the initial scheduled departure flight time, inbound to Canada,

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.466
if travelling by air.

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:29.332
Anyone who is absent from Canada for more than 72 hours, and is not in possession of a negative test result upon arrival for any reason,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.799
must be referred to a PHAC Officer.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.633
PHAC Officers will exercise discretion when selecting the appropriate enforcement action for such travellers, considering information

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.599
specific to the circumstances.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.833
If the traveller is arriving by land, and they are reasonably close to the 72-hour threshold where the delay is out of the traveller’s control

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:56.166
(weather, line-up at the border etc), then the quarantine officer has the discretion to apply the extraordinary circumstances exemption.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:01.932
For example, the border crossing has been extremely busy all day, with a three-hour line up to cross the border.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:05.733
In this case, the Quarantine Officer may decide to apply the exemption.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:14.566
If a traveller is arriving by air, and their absence from Canada exceeds 72 hours, then there is no discretion to extend the timeline or exempt

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.699
air travellers from the test requirement.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.000
However, in these instances, PHAC Officers may issue the traveller a Notice of Non-Compliance if they’re on-site or a verbal

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.533
warning if they’re off-site.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:32.699
PHAC Officers will process these travellers like any other fully vaccinated traveller to Canada who does not have evidence of a valid

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.333
pre-entry test result.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:40.433
This means that the traveller will be required to take a Day 1 COVID-19 molecular test and remain in quarantine

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.999
until they receive their results.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.900
It is important to record the details, of all land or air referrals who are outside of the 72-hour arrival period, promptly in QCMS!

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.566
Entry in QCMS will enable appropriate escalation of enforcement measures taken with the traveller, should noncompliance occur

00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:57.499
again.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.433
Children under the age of 12, who are not fully vaccinated, and are travelling with an adult of legal custody are also eligible for the

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:08.299
exemption, however they are still subject to a modified quarantine:

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.000
They must take day 1 and day 8 tests and avoid group settings including schools and daycare.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.100
As always, PHAC staff working at points of entry should be diligent with existing PPE practice.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.633
