          <img src="./assets/img/unsplash/unsplash_escalator.jpg" style="padding-top: 2em">

          <p class="lang" data-localize="3-1">In the following screens, you will find some of the components of a
            framework that you should consider as you put together the details of your implementation plan. These
            components are highly interconnected and could be stand-alone or integrated with other activities. For
            example, during an inspection it is possible to educate stakeholders and promote the use of best practices.
            Integration with other programs may also be possible and could present an opportunity to advance biosafety
            and biosecurity efforts through existing activities (e.g., mandatory training through post-secondary
            institutions). The cost of the compliance strategy will need to be considered in your options development,
            and activities prioritized based on their potential to achieve compliance.</p>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="3-2">An implementation plan has a number of components categorized under the
            <strong>internal and external sections of the implementation plan.</strong> These will be discussed in the
            following screens.</p>

          <section class="alert-info">
            <h3 class="lang" data-localize="3-3">Something to think about</h3>
            <p class="lang" data-localize="3-4">As you go through the components categorized under the internal and
              external sections, you will notice that many of the activities are connected (e.g., if training is not yet
              available for new staff and needs to be developed, or if training will be required on a new IT system,
              this will push back the dates that new staff need to be brought on board). It is, therefore, recommended
              that you develop a critical path (various project management software are available for this) before you
              estimate the overall time to implement and the timing of milestones along the way.</p>

          <h2 class="lang" data-localize="Title-6">Implementation Considerations – Framework Components</h2>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="6-1">The following are some of the framework components that you should
            consider as you put together the details of your implementation plan:</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-2">Governance structure</li>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-3">Compliance Promotion</li>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-4">Verification</li>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-5">Enforcement</li>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-6">Education and Training Program</li>
            <li class="lang" data-localize="6-7">Communications Strategy</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="6-8">Each of these will be discussed in greater detail in the screens to
            follow.</p>

          <h3 class="lang" data-localize="6-9">Governance Structure</h3>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="6-10">A governance structure describes how departments/agencies/organizations
            relate to one another and define authority and management roles. Governance is important to make sure that
            rules, norms, and actions are sustained, regulated, and held accountable. The formality of your structure
            will depend on the internal rules and environment of your organization.</p>

          <h3 class="lang" data-localize="6-11">Compliance Promotion</h3>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="6-12">Compliance promotion activities are aimed at increasing awareness,
            educating, and motivating stakeholders to change or maintain target behaviours. Helping stakeholders
            understand requirements allows them to make informed decisions about compliance and can reduce
            non-compliance. Stakeholder consultation activities during the development of a national system are a good
            opportunity to understand what type of communication and support will be required to increase the chances of
            widespread compliance. Compliance promotion should use effective communication techniques tailored to
            specific audiences or for broad communication.</p>

          <section class="alert-info">
            <h3 class="lang" data-localize="6-13">What to do when designing education and training support?</h3>
            <p class="lang" data-localize="6-14">In order to design education and training support, it is necessary to
              first assess the number and types of stakeholders who will need to be trained and determine their needs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="lang" data-localize="6-15">Consider whether sector-specific training should be provided (e.g.,
                academic institutions, public health laboratories)</li>
              <li class="lang" data-localize="6-16">Determine the objectives of education and training activities, how
                training will be delivered (e.g., targeted outreach through train-the-trainer approach, on-line versus
                on-site), and who can provide training (e.g. a third party, the regulator)</li>
              <li class="lang" data-localize="6-17">Determine if there is a formal (or even legal) requirement for
                education and training so that a framework is in place to have it delivered appropriately and
                consistently to stakeholders</li>
              <li class="lang" data-localize="6-18">Consider the education and training needs of individuals who will be
                implementing the various program components (e.g., inspectors, licensing or permit program employees),
                if you are building a new compliance program</li>

          <p class="lang" data-localize="15-1">The purpose of the Quarantine Act is to protect public health by taking
            comprehensive measures to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases. Orders in Council
            (emergency measures) are additional measures in times of pandemics such as COVID-19. If travellers are not
            compliant, there are ways to enforce the Act, however the goal is promotion, education and compliance, not
            enforcement.</p>
